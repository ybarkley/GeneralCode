title: "Find Duplicate Whistles"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

This script identifies duplicate values between the whistles selected by P.Rex (2014) and those remeasured by YB (2017). 

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
w = read.csv('C:\\Users\\Yvonne\\Documents\\PHD\\CHP1-FKW\\data\\nwhi14.csv')

#Combine values from the original and new whistle numbers into one vector
orig <- w$original 
new <- w$new
vector <- c(orig, new)
#print duplicate values
sort(vector[duplicated(vector)])
```


#Test it out here
w = read.csv('C:\\Users\\Yvonne\\Documents\\PHD\\CHP1-FKW\\data\\test.csv')
orig <- w$original
new <- w$new
vector <- c(orig, new)
vector[duplicated(vector)]



#example
dat <- data.frame(id=c(1,1,3),id2=c(1,1,4),somevalue=c("x","y","z"))
dat1 <- dat[duplicated(dat[,c('id','id2')]),]
dat[row.names(unique(dat[,c("id", "id2")])),]

# Remove duplicated rows based on Sepal.Length
w1 = distinct(w, original, new)
duplicated(w$original)
# First assign your "id"s to an R object.
# Here's a hypothetical example:
id <- c("a","b","b","c","c","c","d","d","d","d")

#To return ALL MINUS ONE duplicated values:
id[duplicated(id)]
## [1] "b" "c" "c" "d" "d" "d"

#To return ALL duplicated values by specifying fromLast argument:
id[duplicated(id) | duplicated(id, fromLast=TRUE)]
## [1] "b" "b" "c" "c" "c" "d" "d" "d" "d"

#Yet another way to return ALL duplicated values, using %in% operator:
id[id %in% unique(id[duplicated(id)])]
## [1] "b" "b" "c" "c" "c" "d" "d" "d" "d"```
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
